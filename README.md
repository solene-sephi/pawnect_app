- Centralize visit and adoption requests.
- Automate repetitive admin tasks.
- Ensure follow-up and tracking of adoptions and foster care.
- Encourage transparency and interaction between users.

## üìö Key Features

- User authentication with role management (visitor, foster family, shelter, admin)
- Animal management (profiles, media, history, filters)
- Foster family application system + validation workflow
- Visit request system with calendar availability
- Internal messaging system and notifications
- Favorites, adoption feedback, and stories
- Interactive map with geolocation of shelters
- Admin panel with statistics and data export
- Automation of recurring validations

‚ö†Ô∏è The project is under development. Some of the features listed are still in progress.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

For a detailed breakdown of the technologies used in this project, including the frameworks, tools, and libraries, please refer to the [Tech Stack documentation](doc/stack.md).

## üîß Getting Started

### Prerequisities

Before you start, make sure you have the following items installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) : to create containers and manage images
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) : to orchestrate multiple containers

### Install project

#### 1. Clone the Project

Clone the repository to your local machine :

```
git clone https://github.com/solene-sephi/pawnect_app.git pawnect
```

This will create a folder named pawnect containing the project files.

#### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Move into the newly created project folder:

```
cd pawnect
```

All further commands should be run from this directory.

#### 3. Build the Docker Images

Build the required Docker images:

```
docker compose build --no-cache
```

The `--no-cache` option ensures that all images are rebuilt from scratch, avoiding potential conflicts from old cached versions.

#### 4. Start the Containers

Start the project and wait for all services to be ready:

```
docker compose up --pull always -d --wait
```

- The `--pull always` flag ensures the latest versions of images are used.
- The `-d` flag runs the containers in the background (detached mode).
- The `--wait` flag ensures the database and other dependencies are ready before continuing.
  Once the command completes, your Symfony application should be running inside Docker.

#### 5. Configure the Database

The project uses PostgreSQL as the database. Docker automatically creates a database and a default user `app` when launching the containers.

#### 6. Check Database Connection

To manually check if the database is up and running, you can open a psql session inside the container:

```
docker compose exec database psql -U app -d app
```

If you can access the database, the setup is correct. Type `\q` to exit.

#### 7. Running Migrations

After setting up the database, apply migrations:

```
docker compose exec php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

This will create the necessary tables for your project.

#### 8. Loading Fixtures

To populate the database with sample data, you can load fixtures:

```
docker compose exec php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

This will insert predefined test data into the database to help you quickly test the application.

#### 9. Running the Project

The application should now be accessible in the browser at:

üîó http://localhost

You‚Äôre all set! üöÄ
